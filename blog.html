            <p class="first">
                Few countries in the world carve such a deep, lasting impression on a traveller as India does.
                Sitting upon layers upon layers of history, there is perhaps no other country on Earth that is home
                to such marked contrasts as India is. India overloads the senses with its cacophony of sounds, its
                vibrant colours and its extreme contradictions. A trip to India is full of the unexpected but one
                thing’s certain: you won’t return home quite the same after the adventure!
                <br>
                There are some parts of the world that, once visited, get into your heart and won’t go. For me,
                India is such a place. When I first visited, I was stunned by the richness of the land, by its lush
                beauty and exotic architecture, by its ability to overload the senses with the pure, concentrated
                intensity of its colors, smells, tastes, and sounds… I had been seeing the world in black & white
                and, when brought face-to-face with India, experienced everything re-rendered in brilliant Lorem,

            <h3 class="upper">1. The People:-</h3>
            <br>
            <p class="inner">The local people in India, particularly in the rural areas, are some of the kindest and
                most hospitable people I’ve encountered in all of my travels. Whether you’re invited into a local’s
                home for a traditional meal or just simply wander the streets and encounter children playing, you’ll
                surely be touched by the warmth of the locals.</p>

            <h1 class="upper">2.The Taj Mahal:-</h1>
            <br>
            <p class="inner">The Taj Mahal, one of the seven wonders of the world, is the most iconic symbol of
                India and is, arguably, the most famous monument in the world. Built by the Emperor Shah Jahan as a
                memorial to his favourite wife, this ‘teardrop on the face of eternity’ is widely considered one of
                the most beautiful architectural wonders ever created. A visit to this marble mausoleum needs to be
                on every traveller’s list
            </p>

            <h1 class="upper">3.The Indian Food:-</h1>
            <br>
            <p class="inner">The food alone is reason enough to travel to India — I sampled some of the most
                delicious food I have ever tasted during my travels there. Indians take their food very seriously
                and the cuisine, :-just like the country itself, is incredibly diverse.
                <br>
                In the North, you’ll taste lots of thick, creamy curries that are moderately spicy. My favourites
                include mutton rogan josh, parathas and tandoori chicken. The food in the north is heavily
                influenced by Persian and Mughlai styles of cooking. Southern Indian cuisine is commonly
                characterised by the use of ingredients such as coconut, seafood and rice and is spicier than food
                in the north. My favourite southern dishes were the masala dosas and fish coconut curries.
                Vegetarians are also well catered for in India, due to the large proportion of Hindus who are
                vegetarian.

            <h1 class="upper">4.The Ganga River:-</h1>
            <br>
            <p class="inner"> The Ganges River runs 2,525 km from the northern Himalayas all the way to the Bay of
                Bengal. It is much more than a river to the one billion Hindus in India and beyond, however. It is
                their lifeblood. Not only does it provide sustenance in the form of fishing, industry and
                agriculture, it is also believed to transport the prayers of believers to heaven and a dip in the
                river is said to purify the soul. Many observant Hindus make a pilgrimage to Varanasi, India’s
                oldest city, to participate in ceremonies or to cremate the dead along the banks of the Ganges.
                Hindus believe that if the ashes are washed away in the river, the soul is guaranteed to be
                transported to heaven and will escape the cycle of rebirth.</p>

            <h1 class="upper">5.The Beaches:-</h1>
            <br>
            <p class="inner">India’s palm-fringed southern beaches are the ideal escape from the frenetic pace of
                the north. While many of the popular beach destinations in Goa are now crowded, the state’s
                southern, more remote beaches are quiet and more pristine. My favourites are Agonda and Palolem,
                about 90 minutes south of Goa’s airport.</p>

            <h1 class="upper">6.The History And Architecture:-</h1>
            <br>
            <p class="inner">India is an exceptionally beautiful and architecturally diverse country filled with
                forts, palaces, mosques, temples, monuments and ancient ruins. Home to the world’s oldest
                civilisation, the architecture of India is rooted in its history, religion and culture.
                Architectural styles have evolved under the influence of countless dynasties as well as the colonial
                period. There are currently 32 UNESCO World Heritage-listed sites across the nation, making India a
                treasure trove for history buffs and design enthusiasts</p>

            <h1 class="upper">7.The Advanture:-</h1>
            <br>
            <p class="inner">No matter where you travel to in India, a keen sense of adventure follows you
                everywhere you go. Whether you’re riding around the southern beaches of Goa on a Royal Enfield,
                trekking snow-capped mountains in the north, attempting to spot Bengal tigers and Indian elephants
                in the wild, or even just navigating the chaotic streets of Delhi, travelling to India is one big
                adventure!</p>
